# Problem Statement
Design an application that, given a set of coordinates [(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...],
determines;

- the two closest points between each other
- the two most distant points between each other
- d=√((x_2-x_1)²+(y_2-y_1)²)

Use your knowledge of Golang with clean code to create
an application with automated tests.

Start with tests or implementation, whatever is better for you.
